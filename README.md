# Minecraft-bot
  Minecraft bot. It is not perfect, but I hope to have fun with it.

 To run this code, you need to download Node.js and use npm to install mineflayer, mineflayer-pvp, mineflayer-pathfinder, mineflayer-armor-manager, and mineflayer-auto-eat.

 Type ‘follow me’ for the bot to start following you, and ‘guard’ for the bot to start guarding the area where you are. If you want the bot to stop, just type ‘stop follow me’ or ‘stop guard’ depending on which mode the bot is him.
